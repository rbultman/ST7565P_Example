# ST7565P_Example
A small example for the ST7565P LCD controller.

This is a small project just to play with interfacing to the 
[New Haven Display NHD-C12864A1Z-FS(RGB)-FBW-HT1](https://www.newhavendisplay.com/nhdc12864a1zfsrgbfbwht1-p-3896.html) 
display.

The [GR-Peach board](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/Renesas-GR-PEACH/) 
was used along with the MBED environment.

This is not a full-fledged driver, but just a little bit of code that is essentially a blinky program for this LCD.
